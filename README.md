# PyWeather
## Purpose
### The purpose of this project was to use an API key from google maps to narrow down cities with temperatures between 70-85 degrees fahrenheit.Next we found hotels in cities with those specific temperatures. After doing this, we were able to narrow down our search even further and plan a potential trip in four cities in Brazil.
